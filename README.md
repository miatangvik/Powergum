# Powergum

School project made for our graduation exhibition.

## Installing

Open the Powergum master folder in Terminal, then run

```
npm install
```

to install dependencies.

Then run

```
npm start
```
to start the server.

Go to

```
localhost:3000
```
in your browser of choice and Powergum should be good to go!

## Optional

If you have an Arduino board, it is possible to use a button connected with your board to "eject" a gum. You need to have StandardFirmataPlus installed on your board.
